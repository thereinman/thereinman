### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm theREINMAN. I am a pilot by trade and enjoy finding new projects and biting off more than I can chew. I am a college graduate, but my degree has nothing to do with computers. I am self taught in this realm and learning as I go.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app to help friends track and share workouts with each other. I am hoping to integrate this with Discord.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Github, Java, and how to be a better pilot.
